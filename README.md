## Requirements

Implement a full-stack application based on the images in `mockups/`

- [ ] Use Angular, Backbone, or React to create a single page front-end. Feel free to use any CSS libraries you wish
- [ ] Use a Node server (with Express if you'd like)
- [ ] Use a SQL or Mongo database to persist all data (with ORMs if you'd like)
- [ ] Fill out the script, `seed.js`, that is responsible for seeding your database with example data from `data.json`
- [ ] Fill out the [How To Start This App](#how-to-start-this-app) section with instructions that can be understood by another developer

Additionally, be sure to update `.gitignore` if you choose to move the installation location of `node_modules` or `bower_components`
